#code-challange1
A function that prompts the user to input student marks.
The code begins by initializing a variable marks
let marks=30;
it then uses if else conditions to evaluate the value of marks
for grade A,if marks is less than 79 then console.log A.
if (marks > 79) {
    console.log("A");
}
for grade B if marks in between 60 and 79,if the marks are greater or equal to 60, and less or equal to 79,
}else if (marks >= 60 && marks <=79){
  console.log("B");  
repeat the same for grade C and D.
for grade E, use else
start with function calculateDemeritpoints(){
    and then prompt the user to input speed by:
    let speed=prompt("enter speed of the car")
    then initialize speed
    speed=(speed,90);
since we are given a speed limit, we set it as a constant.
if speed is less than speed limit, then console.log "Ok"
